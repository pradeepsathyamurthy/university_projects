Hackathon on Sales prediction dataset:
=========================================
https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

Knowledge applied from course:
================================
1. CSC-423 - Data Analysis and Regression
2. CSC-424 - Advance Data Analysis
3. CSC-465 - Data Visualisation
4. CSC-433 - Scripting for Data Analytics

Steps that would be tried:
==========================
1. We will start with OLS
2. Then try with few stepwise algorithms
3. We will apply PCA on data, there by compromising some adj R^2 but trying to improve the RMSE value

Reading the dataset:
====================
