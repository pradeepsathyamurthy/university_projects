# University Project
If you are a University student, kindly use this page as your reference only and provide the citation of my GitHub page whereever required.
Just a copy and paste of my code in your project directly will neither impart any knowledge to you nor gain you any confident in your course work later. Acquiring skill set is more important than graduating with 4/4 GPA.
Thank you for visiting my page and all the best for all your work!!!
